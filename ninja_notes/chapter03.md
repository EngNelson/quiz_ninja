# Arrays, Logic, and Loops
In the last chapter we were introduced to JavaScript’s primitive values, and also
did a bit of programming. In this chapter we’re going to look at arrays, a useful data
structure for storing lists of values. We’ll also look at logical statements that allow
us to control the flow of a program, as well as loops that allow us to repeat blocks
of code over and over again.

# We will cover the following topics:
■ array literals
■ adding and removing values from arrays
■ array methods
■ if and else statements
■ switch statements
■ while loops
■ do ... while loops
■ for loops
■ iterating over an array
■ our project―use arrays, loops, and logic to ask multiple questions in our quiz

# Arrays
An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair
of square brackets:
var myArray = [];
<< []
function myArray() {
    // code to be executed.
};

var Ilome =  24;
if ( Ilome < 14 ){
    alert("she is not allowed);
}
