# Reserved Words
- The following words are reserved for use by the language and cannot be used to
name variables (or the function parameters and object properties that appear in later
chapters):
# * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
# abstract, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const,
# continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum,
# export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function,
# goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, inteface,
# long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public,
# return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw,
# throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while,with

- These words are reserved because many of them are used by the language itself,
and you will come across them later in this book.

-Many are not used by the language, however; one can only assume they were planned
to be used at some point, but never were. There are also a few words not reserved
that should have been as they are an important part of the language:
- undefined, NaN, Infinity.

- These are covered later in this chapter. You should also avoid using these words
for variable names.

# Assignment
- To assign a value to a variable, we use the = operator. This example shows how we
would set the variable name to point to the string literal "Walter" :

var name; // declare the variable first
<< undefined
name = "Walter"; // assign the variable to a string
<< "Walter"

- Once the variable has been assigned a value, it is displayed in the console output.
To see the value of a variable, simply enter it in the console. The variable name now
refers to the string "Walter" , so it will behave exactly the same as that string:

name;
<< "Walter"
typeof name;
<< "string"

-This is a useful way of dealing with long strings as it saves us from typing them
over and over again. Itâ€™s also useful if the value stored in the variable is likely to
change (hence the name, variable).

You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time:
var name = "Jesse";
<< "Jesse"

- You can also declare and assign values to multiple variables in a single statement:
var x = 2, y, z = "Hi!"; // y has only been declared, it's undefined
<< undefined
